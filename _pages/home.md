    excerpt: "We offer peer review of Python software to increase the quality, usability and long term maintenance of the open source tools that drive open science. [JOSS accepts our review as theirs](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/joss.html) so you can get the benefits of pyOpenSci and JOSS through one review."

    title: "Community Partnerships"
    excerpt: "We partner with domain-specific scientific Python communities such as [Pangeo](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/pangeo.html) who want to review affiliated packages. Through this collaboration, we develop community-specific standards that are used in our reviews to evaluate whether a package meets affiliation requirements. This removes the need for communities to develop their own peer review process."

    excerpt: "We are creating a beginner-friendly, **community-driven Python packaging guide**. Our guide is reviewed by members of the Python Packaging Authority, maintainers of core packaging tools and members of the scientific Python community. It recommends best practices for you to follow when creating a Python package."
